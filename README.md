Description


A full release of Situation Outbreak's source code available for non-commercial use and open for the Source modding community to use.

This is really it: Situation Outbreak's source code.

After much debating whether or not to release this, I talked it over with my co-lead developer, Jordan, and we agreed to go on and do it. Why? When SO returns - which I have no doubt in my mind that it will someday - we're going to start from scratch. The current codebase is very convoluted and bloated as some of you are about to find out as for at least the first half of the mod's development, we had no idea what we were doing coding-wise. Now that we've both had some time to reflect on it, we simply cannot continue developing Situation Outbreak under the same codebase. That being said, it can still be a learning tool for many upcoming Source engine developers out there, which is why it was ultimately released to the public.

You are more than welcome to use this source code for non-commercial use; if you plan on using it to sell or promote a product you are going to sell, we ask that you refrain to do so. Valve is very stingy about their assets sometimes, so you might get into some serious trouble.

Anyhow, yeah, enjoy. Hopefully someone will put this to good use until we return to development.
